<p>Sometimes you need a very high quality image - beyond what MidJourney
is capable of outputting - and you're not sure how to get it. MidJourney
doesn't (at the time of writing) do 4K images, since it won't go above
~3m pixels
(https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/resource-links/understanding-image-size#midjourney-image-sizes).
To get there, you'll need to scale up another way.</p>
<p>For more in the official manual, see <a
href="https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/resource-links/understanding-image-size">https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/resource-links/understanding-image-size</a><br />
== Example Image == <img src="static/Guide-Images/ArtMechanicum/ScalingUpImages/Original.png" title="Original Image"
alt="Original Image" /> I'll be using a simple example generated by
MidJourney through these to illustrate differences. I've scaled it down
on purpose to illustrate upscaling.</p>
<p><br />
== Basic Upscaling == <img src="static/Guide-Images/ArtMechanicum/ScalingUpImages/Paint.net.png" title="Basic Upscale"
width="100" height="100" alt="Basic Upscale" /> You can, of course,
plunk your image into any editor and upscale it. Here's an example of
scaled up by 10x using paint.net (https://www.getpaint.net/). While this
looks the same in this little shot, it's blurry once you open the full
image.</p>
<p><br />
== (Free) Super Resolution API == <img
src="Super_Resolution_API_-_4X.jpg" title="Super Resolution API - 4X"
width="100" height="100" alt="Super Resolution API - 4X" /> <img
src="Super_Resolution_API_-_16X.jpg" title="Super Resolution API - 16X"
width="100" height="100" alt="Super Resolution API - 16X" /> You can
scale up using Super Resolution API as well
(https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/torch-srgan) which uses
machine learning for better results. Just upload your image and it'll
give you an upscaled version! Use it multiple times if you need larger
pictures ;).</p>
<p>Unfortunately here you can't choose a specific size, so here is the
default upscale run once (4x), and then twice (16x original).<br />
== Gigapixel == <img src="static/Guide-Images/ArtMechanicum/ScalingUpImages/Gigapixel_Upscale_Standard_to_10x.png"
title="Gigapixel Upscale Standard to 10x" width="100" height="100"
alt="Gigapixel Upscale Standard to 10x" /> <img
src="Gigapixel_Upscale_Standard_to_10x_in_2_steps.png"
title="Gigapixel Upscale Standard to 10x in 2 steps" width="100"
height="100" alt="Gigapixel Upscale Standard to 10x in 2 steps" /> Paid
software also exists in this space - Topaz Lab's Gigapixel is one such
AI upscaler (https://www.topazlabs.com/gigapixel-ai). By default it will
only use AI up to 6x, and a normal upscale past that. You can, just like
Super Resolution, upscale with AI multiple times for the size you
desire. It also has several modes - here I've used the default but there
are many many knobs and dials to play with. Here are two examples - one
with default settings to 10X directly (AI to 6x, then normal to 10x),
and one in 2 steps (5x followed by 2x).</p>
<p><br />
== Photoshop == <img

title="Photoshop &quot;Preserve Details 2.0&quot; to 10x" width="100"
height="100" alt="Photoshop &quot;Preserve Details 2.0&quot; to 10x" />
Another paid option is to use Photoshop, which has "Preserve Details
Upscale"
(https://www.photoshopessentials.com/basics/upscale-images-photoshop-cc-2018/
has some instructions), which works better than a basic upscale. There
are less dials here, but more folks may have Photoshop than other paid
options.</p>
