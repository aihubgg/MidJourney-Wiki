| What is this three basket syndrome?<br>                                             | 7/11/2022 | Some users decided to test Midjourney’s spatial-awareness capabilities by asking it to generate a picture of three separate baskets of fruit. In each basket there must be a different fruit. Other challenges include making realistic human hands, and coherent eyes (though actual reasons for the difficulties are unique between challenges). As far as I can tell, the 3 basket issue has yet to be accomplished, and is a great metaphor for not letting one concept or idea take up all your precious GPU time. Especially if Midjourney simply isn’t yet capable of generating the image you have in your mind (or if the knowledge to do so isn’t yet known). Have fun and try new things. |
| Can I just make one large image right from the start instead of creating a grid?    | 7/11/2022 | Not at this time. You first make a grid, then you select which individual image(s) to upscale or create variations of using the U1–4 or V1–4 buttons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| What is Light Upscale Redo, or \`—uplight\`?                                        | 7/11/2022 | When selecting Light Upscale Redo on an upscaled image after selecting U1–4, the image will be re-upscaled by uplight for a softer and slightly less detailed result.<br>By adding \`—uplight\` to the end of your prompt, the U1–4 buttons will automatically use the light upscaler to upscale your images, instead of using the default upscaler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| What is the difference between the default upscaler and the light upscaler/uplight? | 7/11/2022 | The best explanation would be to test it out yourself! In short, the default upscaler adds lots of detail and sometimes extra “AI-ness” to images, which can often differ from the original grid image you chose. The light upscaler/uplight tones down the details and generates a softer image often closer to the original grid image you chose.<br>See this page for visual examples: https://github.com/willwulfken/MidJourney-Styles-and-Keywords-Reference/blob/main/Summary\_Pages/MJ\_V2/Image\_Upscale\_Comparison.md                                                                                                                                                                      |
| How do I make my picture look like this?<br>                                        | 7/12/2022 | In the most basic terms, describe it as best you can without making your prompt too long. If you want a ball on a field of green grass, but want the ball to be red, you could try \`red ball on a field of green grass\`. What you want may be much more complicated than that. Being succinct, but descriptive, should produce better results than being verbose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Does punctuation like commas, periods, etc. matter?                                 | 7/12/2022 | Yes, but no. Different punctuation will provide different results, but they don't provide you with a way to segment different parts of your prompt. Double colons (\`::\`) are used to separate parts of your prompt into weighted sections (ex: \`cartoon :: dog ::1 cat ::1 fish ::-0.5\`). See this post for some visual examples on \`::\` and separations:<br>[https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/992207085146222713/996970514818019368](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/992207085146222713/996970514818019368)                                                                                                                                                    |
| What is \`--test\`?                                                                 | 7/13/2022 | As of now, adding \`--test\` to the end of your prompt will generate a result using the new algorithm/model (July 13 2022). \`--test\` might eventually become the default after some model tweaks, and the current model (without \`--test\`) might be given its own parameter (something like \`--old\`). This is similar to even older models like \`--vibe\`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Concerning colour palettes<br>                                                      | 7/14/2022 | While MJ won't respond to hex codes, it does seem to respond decently to fairly specific colour names. Comparing them to colours on HTML colour reference sites shows that it can usually get close enough for creative purposes. For now it seems pretty effective to look up the name of the tone closest to each one you want (on a site like htmlcsscolor.com or even wikipedia) and apply it to your prompt. Some colour names (like "atlantis" or "moccasin") are homonyms, so MJ could struggle to properly match the phrase to a colour.                                                                                                                                                     |
| What is a seed, \`--seed\`, and \`--sameseed\`?                                     | 7/14/2022 | A seed is used to generate noise (think randomness) for all 4 images at once. The noise is different for each image. \`--seed\` means that the random noise added during the initialization of the generation will be the same each time, but GPUs are non-deterministic, so the images won't look exactly the same. So, \`--seed \[integer\]\` sets the random seed, which can sometimes help keep things more steady/reproducible between generations.<br>\`--sameseed \[integer\]\` sets the same seed across all 4 images of the resulting grid.                                                                                                                                                 |
| How do I get the seed that was used for a grid?<br>                                 | 7/14/2022 | React to your image grid with the envelope emoji , and it will send it to you in DM. You may want to do this if you had satisfactory results, and want to try to reproduce these results with a different prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Can I use photography terms in Midjourney?<br>                                      | 7/19/2022 | Yes, and sometimes it works very well! \`35mm photograph\` is a good way to turn your image into something semi-realistic with a semi-film look.
