<summary>07/13/2022 - Multiple arguments in the --no command</summary>
<br>
<p>Using the <code>--no</code> command, you can list multiple items for it to deprioritize from your image. You might still get some of that, but it should be significantly reduced. You can only have one <code>--no</code> command unless you add additional weight to other parts of the prompt, as <code>--no</code> is equivalent to a weight of <code>-0.5</code> and anything at 0 or lower gets really weird.</p>
