<summary>07/13/2022 - Multiple arguments in the --no command</summary>
<br>
<p>Using the <code>--no</code> command, you can list multiple items for it to deprioritize from your image. You might still get some of that, but it should be significantly reduced. You can only have one <code>--no</code> command unless you add additional weight to other parts of the prompt, as <code>--no</code> is equivalent to a weight of <code>-0.5</code> and anything at 0 or lower gets really weird.</p>

<summary>07/13/2022 - A basic list of focal lengths for camera lenses and their normal  usage</summary>
<br>
This isnâ€™t an exhaustive list by any means just a point in the right direction. <br>

As a general guide, the best practice will likely include looking at lens from the three most common manufacturers Canon, Nikon and Sony, to find different standard focal lengths as these will be most prevalent in the dataset. The list lens are all considered Prime lenses due to their fixed focal length. <br>

As a bonus, a 40mm focal length is generally agreed to represent our field of vision. <br>

A point in the right direction. Iâ€™d encourage people to look at different samples of photos taken at these focal lengths, to have a better understanding of them. <br>

<summary>08/02/2022 - It's dangerous out there, take this! Fantasy Medieval Weapons Guide</summary>
<br>
<p>[Note: For v3 era]</p>
<p>You wish to prompt up your own weapons? Just know, this requires A TON of googling and rerolling/vrolling, so pepper your angus.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of the prompt I use to make my weapons:</p>
<p><code>ornate border frame containing nocked bow and arrow :: legendary insanely intricate whitewood recurve bow with gilded angel wings tips ends elvish :: by Bayard-Wu + by Anato-Finnstark :: Artstation game concept art :: full body standing upright recurve shortbow display shot :: dark ancient knowledge paper --ar 7:11 --uplight --v 3 --s 1350</code></p>
<p>What do all of these do?</p>
<p><code>ornate border frame containing nocked bow and arrow</code></p>
<p>-This frames up the image for MJ to know the final image will be framed and the item we want will be inside this frame.</p>
<p><code>legendary insanely intricate whitewood recurve bow with gilded angel wings tips ends elvish</code></p>
<p>-I know, the grammar here is trash, but it&#39;s trash for a reason.</p>
<p>-The beggining sets up how finely detailed the materials and weapon will be.</p>
<p>-I use &quot;recurve bow&quot; here to narrow down MJ&#39;s data to any similar weapons. For example, I made a greatsword using: Greatsword, Zweihander, Longsword, Dragon-slayer.</p>
<p>-The final part mentions the parts I want fully visible on the weapon. Mentioning the tips and adding details to them coerces MJ to render them out. I haven&#39;t noticed any impact by using proper grammar here, and we have to avoid confusing MJ with too many words as well.</p>
<p><code>by Bayard-Wu + by Anato-Finnstark</code></p>
<p>-I want the art to be done by some famous game concept artists. You can choose other artists/games here. The more related they are to your weapon, the higher success chance you&#39;ll have.</p>
<p><code>Artstation game concept art</code></p>
<p>-More coercing towards fantasy medieval art/game concept art tends to display the full weapon.</p>
<p><code>full body standing upright recurve shortbow display shot</code></p>
<p>-More coercing towards the final result.  <strong>Full body display shot</strong> helps a TON with avoiding cutting off images.</p>
<p><code>Dark ancient knowledge paper</code></p>
<p>-This helps make the backgrounds for a lot of my weapons. Try to change the words to fit your style. For example, I use wild-west outlaw paper for cowboy stuff.</p>
<p><code>--ar 7:11 --uplight --v 3 --s 1350</code></p>
<p>-This is all your choice. --ar x:y determines the aspect ratio. You want tall weapon? Make tall ar. You want long weapon? Make long ar.</p>
<p>-I tend to leave out --uplight lately because I like v3&#39;s upscaler.</p>
<p>-I like using a middle ground for the --s value. I enjoy MJ&#39;s chaos. It&#39;s beautiful. But I like influencing that chaos too.</p>
<p>I hope this helps! If you need more ideas/help, reach out to me in &lt;#992207085146222713&gt; or feel free to DM me!</p>

<summary>08/01/2022 - For Less &quot;Overpainted&quot; Paintings</summary>
<br>
<p>If you&#39;ve experimented enough with MidJourney you may find that sometimes it&#39;s not the best at getting your textures right, at least, not without a dozen string of tags to help ensure it- but fret not, there&#39;s a good way of working with Midjourney&#39;s Variation to &quot;add&quot; detail to a relatively underpainted image, getting that <em>juuuust</em> right.</p>
<p>We&#39;re going to be utilizing the <code>--quality</code> tag and also the <code>--stop</code> tag to tell MJ to stop right before we stop off.</p>
<p><strong>I would recommend somewhere in your prompt to include <code>rough brush strokes</code> in order to help encourage MidJourney to capture that painterly style.</strong></p>
<p>For this example we&#39;re going to be using a simple prompt.</p>
<p><code>man holding a garbage bag, pinching his nose, rough brush strokes --q 2 --stop 40 --ar 2:3 --v 3</code></p>
<p>Mostly self explanatory, <code>--q</code> being short for Quality. (I personally am not too sure how different it is from <code>--q 1 --stop 80</code> but there seems to be one.)</p>
<p>Feel free to adjust the stop and quality settings as you see fit, these are just the settings that have good replicable results in my experience.)</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/989053837597868032/1005810297107398676/Lyman_man_holding_a_garbage_bag_pinching_his_nose_rough_brush_s_57f9331f-fd35-43d0-b413-49ccfc7f67fe.png"><img alt="Midjourney Discord Picture" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/989053837597868032/1005810297107398676/Lyman_man_holding_a_garbage_bag_pinching_his_nose_rough_brush_s_57f9331f-fd35-43d0-b413-49ccfc7f67fe.png"></a></p>
<p>Rough sketches, right? Try to pick the image that has an adequete amount of detail while still leaving room for extra layers of detail to be on. (e.g. You&#39;d prefer over all face shape over intricate facial features)</p>
<p>The way that variations seem to work is they add on this extra coating of detailing to your images, which translate even to images that were halted in generation like ours, ending up with that little bit of &quot;painterly flair&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/989053837597868032/1005810573948244079/Lyman_man_holding_a_garbage_bag_pinching_his_nose_rough_brush_s_ebc1f667-c17b-41cc-abe7-cab5f72cad2e.png"><img alt="Midjourney Discord Picture" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/989053837597868032/1005810573948244079/Lyman_man_holding_a_garbage_bag_pinching_his_nose_rough_brush_s_ebc1f667-c17b-41cc-abe7-cab5f72cad2e.png"></a></p>
<p>And just for comparison, here&#39;s what a no stop, quality 2 version of these prompts look like with the same seed.</p>
