Find a style you like and then run with what MJ gives you.<br>2\. Explore variations. A lot. Like … a \*lot\*. It's usually rewarding.<br>3\. Faces and hands and "correct" figures are \*really hard\* (right now). Try to come up with concepts that avoid them or allow flexibility with them (shattered glass, fast action, busy crowds, etc)<br>4\. It is usually best to stick to the simplest single term you can use to describe your subject, and you should ALWAYS try that first. However, for SOME subjects where MJ seems to struggle, it seems to respond \*very\* well (IMO) to redundancy. Don't just say \`dragon\`, say \`dragon gecko anole lizard monitor\`. I find this leads to more cohesive results. By default MJ "merges" all terms.<br>5\. MJ merges all terms by default! 😄 Focus on one subject at a time. If you're trying to describe a chef at a stove cooking eggs with her husband at the sink and pots are hanging over the island and light is coming in from the win—just \*stop!\* It's not likely to work. Start with "a chef cooking at a stove" and run variations until you see one you like. Works MUCH better.<br>6\. Don't worry about \`::\` weights for your first few days. ...but eventually, circle back to them! Personally I find these SUPER powerful, but you should understand how MidJourney works before getting into them.<br>7\. Learn what "magical thinking" is and ALWAYS keep this in mind. Seriously.<br>8\. Aspect Ratio really matters. More than you think. It interacts strongly with the subject.<br>9\. Always look in the Gallery first. ALWAYS LOOK IN THE GALLERY FIRST.<br>10\. Search images.google.com for the term you want to try. It will give you hints about what MJ \*probably\* thinks the term means, and it may lead you to finding a better term (or two or three) that will do better.<br> |
| How do I get rid of all the blurry stuff?                                               | 7/11/2022 | Start with \`--no dof,blur,bokeh,depth of field\` at the end of your prompt. …but also be mindful that some styles REALLY want to blur things. Watch out for photographers names (e.g.: \`Steve McCurry\`), rendering engines (\`octane render\` is a common culprit of blurring), and the like: they really like to blow out the background. Another common problem is \`8k\`, which will often cause the depth of field to be very narrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| How do I get text in my image?                                                          | 7/11/2022 | Post processing is DEFINITELY your best bet. MJ doesn't really "speak" at all and you can't force it to do text correctly. You can keep "rerolling" and it might work, but that's tedious. Much easier to just get a good image and use post processing for the text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

SOME punctuation seems to matter. \`this…\` is NOT the same as \`this\` but it's not clear to what extent those exceptions occur nor what they "mean". The one major exception is \`this :: that\` ...which, as written, is STILL the same as \`this that\` but the purpose of the \`::\` is that it can be used to "weigh" subjects. The default weight is 1 (which is 100%). So \`this ::0.5 that\` means you want 50% of this and 100% of that. NO SPACE is allowed between the colon and the number. Yes, you \*can\* use values higher than 1, so \`::2\` \*effectively\* means 200%. Another minor exception with symbols seems to be \`>\` which appears to be "inside of", so \`this > that\` tends to put this IN that. Not always, but enough that we think it's "real". 😄 …For more information and examples, see https://rexwang8.github.io/resource/ai/prompts and [https://sites.google.com/view/understanding-mj-prompts/home](https://sites.google.com/view/understanding-mj-prompts/home)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Why do faces often go wonky? Is there any way to avoid this?                            | 7/11/2022 | As always, start by checking the main feed and finding some examples you like, and stealing the prompts! But if you have done that, in prompt-craft, our best attempts suggest that faces will work better if you:<br>A) reference a well-known name or two to draw from, and/or<br>B) describe them with an emotion e.g.: \`happy face\` or if you specify a style of makeup: \`face with natural makeup\`, and/or<br>C) if you use a style that is prone to nice faces (e.g. artstation), and/or<br>D) use an image prompt with a moderately high weight (e.g.: \`--iw 0.7\`)<br>…other than that: variations, variations, variations! It is \*normal\* to have to reroll and veroll multiple times to get a consistent figure or face.<br>Also, pay attention to <@174164654111588352> 's posts, below: he's quite good at getting faces to work well.<br>You can also post-process a face with something like FaceApp:<br>[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.faceapp&hl=en\_US&gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.faceapp&hl=en_US&gl=US)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

You might try post-processing using this technique:<br>https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN<br>using this tool:<br>https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sVsoBd9AjckIXThgtZhGrHRfFI6UUYOo#scrollTo=CdMZYp0T7NAy<br>You can also post-process a face with something like FaceApp:<br>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.faceapp&hl=en\_US&gl=US<br>But a few tips:<br>1\. Describe the person's emotion. That seems to help. Sometimes makeup does, too.<br>2\. Reference an a famous person or two to "model." It will merge multiple names for a more unique look, but it will be more cohesive.<br>3\. Try \`symmetrical face\`, that does seem to help (a bit)<br>4\. Make sure you're using a photographic or rendering style, if you aren't going for a "painted" look.

| I like how imagea looks in the previews, before it's done. Can I tell it to stop early? | 7/12/2022 | Yes! The command is --stop N where N is a percentage between 1 and 100; most people seem to like ranges between 65 and 85, you have to experiment to find which you like best. It must be part of your prompt (you can't use it on an image that has already been generated), so you need to know before hand that you will want a more "painterly" look. I don't recommend using it all that often, though, as you'll lose fine detail where you DO want it.

| How can I make my results look more realistic and less painted?                         | 7/12/2022 | MJ's default style is painting, which is why you're seeing that. You need to specify another style, most effectively using \`by \[artist\]\`. I think the consensus is either to invoke a photographer or a rendering engine: both yield pretty good "realistic" results. But you can also just say \`photograph of ...\` or \`3D render of ...\`. Also, please do look through the gallery and STEAL RUTHLESSLY.

| What is the best Aspect Ratio for portraits? Why is my portrait getting two heads?      | 7/15/2022 | It's probably your aspect ratio. The best ARs for portraits are \`4:5\`, \`3:4\`, \`2:3\`, and \`5:8\`. A default (1x1) will tend to give you a "profile picture" style shot, and anything taller than those formats will start generating extra heads and other undesirables more often. Counterintuitively, a \*wider\* format, like \`3:2\` or \`16:9\`, may give you a decent portrait, because the AI was trained on enough TV media to be familiar with popular compositions in that style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| How do I zoom out / show the whole subject / move the camera back?                      | 7/18/2022 | wide angle\` or \`wide angle shot\` or \`establishing shot\` seem to be worth trying, as well as \`16mm\` or \`24mm\`, but ... still, this is hard to get consistently. Also, pay attention to your Aspect Ratio: this has a \*huge\* effect on the composition for Midjourney, and you should make sure you're using an appropriate proportion to adequately fit the subject: MJ really wants to "fill the frame."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Can I edit the prompt of an image I've already generated?                               | 7/18/2022 | Sorry, no. But you \*can\* get the seed from the image (see the previous FAQ entry) and use that to regenerate a very similar one. Just add \`--seed N\` to the end of your prompt, where "N" is the number you got back from Midjourney.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| How do I get an entire object in my frame?<br>                                          | 7/20/2022 | ...First, you should definitely use a wide or tall aspect ratio. 1:1 makes it VERY hard to fit a whole object in.<br>...Second, you should specify a "style" that is more likely to include the whole object. \`product shot\` is a common one, and sometimes \`commercial\` works.<br>...Third, you can try to describe both "ends" of the object, which makes it more likely for them both to be in the shot. \`sword with a metal hilt and pointed tip\` is more likely to work. ...unless it gets too wordy. :S                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
